# Possible problems

1. What about courses with 1, 2 credits? How to calculate the optimized points needed?

    Answer: Go to page 3, the target and the restriction here is not that precise. We can also say maximize the credit units here.
    Thus, there optimized points will be 9 and 13 respectively.

2. In page 5, the user still have chances to lose all 4 courses if all students apply the optimized strategy?

    Answer: Sure. We can modify the system to use pseudo random to make the users gain either 3 or 4 courses, which is larger than 2 courses. Moreover, the expectation for the user using the optimized result is 3.8 which is also larger than 2, too.

3. In page 6, why free elective here needs 25 points rather than major elective?

    Answer: Because of assumption, the quota will larger than the sum of major required and major elective students number. We will have some free elective students to join the courses. We can assume that all these students will join the course with 25 willingness points. And we sort them. And we will find that, the students with more weighs waste their points, as they don't need that much. And they will decrease their consuming approaching the results in the table.
